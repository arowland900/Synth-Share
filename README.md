### Installation Instructions
- Download this directory from GitHub to a local directory on your machine
- Open Terminal
- Open the project directory and type in: npm i (This will install any and all npm packages needed to run the app)
- Make sure you have MongoDB, if not, download it from the MongoDB site.
- Initiate a Mongo Local Server with command `mongod` within your terminal
- Open a new terminal tab and make sure you are not in MongoDB or have a node server open in that tab.
- Open another tab and type `npm start` this will start up a local node server to run the app
- Open a new tab on your browser and type in localhost:3000 in the address bar. (If you encounter an error, or a different application loads, make sure you do not have a previous local server running in a different terminal tab.)
- All Set! You can now create synths :)

## Bonus Features
- I would like to make the synth model more robust, and to embellish on the styling of the site.
